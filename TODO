**Features the Application should have:**

1. Users should be able to see a list of at least 100 dog images by default when they load the application.
2. Users should be able to click on a dog image and be routed to a page where there’s more information about the dog.
3. Users should be able to search for a dog via their breeds.

**Things We Expect the SPA to have:**

1. The application should mandatorily use a state machine (use Vuex).
2. Good loading indicator or mechanism on the SPA so that users can know that they are expecting a response instead of a blank page.
3. Lazy loading of the images (In simple & clear terms, images that the user can’t see shouldn’t be loaded until the user scrolls down to them)
4. Client-side caching to avoid multiple round trips to the server API.
5. The application should be responsive.
6. The codebase should be component-based, clean, maintainable and reusable.
7. The application should have a very neat and decent UI.

**Note:** The application should be hosted on Netlify. The code should be hosted on GitHub. Please let your GIT commits show your progress in building this app.
